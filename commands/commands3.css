***************** How CSS Works: A Look Behind the Scenes *****************
1. 
  a) Responsive Design
  b) Maintenable and Scalable Code
  c) Web Performance

2. Responsive Design
  - Fluid layouts
  - Media queries
  - Responsive images
  - Correct units
  - Desktop-first vs Mobile-first

3. Maintenable and Scalable Code
  Write code that is:
  - Clean
  - Easy to understand
  - Growth
  - Reusable
  - How to organize files
  - How to name classes
  - How to structure HTML

4. Web Performance
  - Less HTTP requests
  - Less code
  - Compress code
  - Use a CSS preprocessor(SAAS)
  - Less images
  - Compress images

5. Css parsing: 
  a) Resolving conflicts:
    1. Importance
      - User !important declarations
      - Author !important declarations
      - Author declarations
      - User declarations
      - Default browser declarations

    2.  Specificity - same Importance
      - Inline styles
      - IDs
      - Classes, pseudo classes, attribute
      - Elements, pseudo elements

      Will calculate like this, an example: inline, ids, classes, elements => (0, 1, 2, 2)
      nav#nav div.pull-right .button
      We read from the left to right and wich one has bigger numbers win

    3. Source Order
      If is all declarations have equal numbers that the last declaration will win
      Always put the autor style sheet the last one 

6. Value processing
  - Each property has an initial value  if nothing is declared(and if there is no inheritance)
  - Browser specify a root font-size for each page
  - Percentage and relative values are always converted to pixels
  - Percentage are measured relative to their parent's font-size, if used to specify font-size
  - Percentage are measured relative to their parent's width, if used to specify lengths
  - em are measured relative to their parent font-size, if used to specify font-size
  - em are measured relative to the current font-size, if used to specify lengths
  - rem are always measured relative to the document's root font-size
  - vh and vw are simply percentage measuraments of the viewport's height and width

7. Change all px in rem units so we can change only 1 value for diff devices
  - use the html {}  for root
  - add in html {} root font-size 10px and comment the 16px in body, because 10px = 1rem
8. Use inheritance where is possible
  - remove 
  box-sizing: border-box;
  in universal selector * and put it in the body
  - in universal selector use:
  box-sizing: inherit
  so in this way we inherit all elements in project with the box-sizing: border-box
